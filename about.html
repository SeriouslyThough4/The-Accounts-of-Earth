                    <br>Hello denizens of Alcazar! If you are reading this,
                     you have reached The Accounts of Earth. I have recently 
                     landed on a planet called ‘Earth,’ as dubbed by its people,
                      and as you are all aware, Earth is one of the many on our 
                      list of ‘considering annihilation.’ As such, I have been given 
                      the honor of inspecting the conditions of this planet and the 
                      behaviors of its inhabitants, and I will be compiling the information
                       for public reference in our next vote.
                </p>
                <p>Happy reading, denizens!</p>
