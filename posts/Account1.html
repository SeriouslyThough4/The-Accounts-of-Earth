                <p>&emsp; I wanted to form my statement in a way 
                    that does not make me look like a lunatic– 
                    I really wanted to, but there are no amount of 
                    words in neither our nor the human’s language that can conceptualize 
                    what I have seen, or rather, what I have not.
                    <br>&emsp; Even as I write this, I look up into the sky, and there is 
                    nothing but endless blue. Where I am there is the occasional puff of 
                    white or grey that the humans have taken to calling ‘clouds.’ When I 
                    first came here, I noticed it almost immediately, and I suddenly became
                     very aware of how cramped this planet feels.</p>

                <p><br>&emsp;On this planet, there is a day and night:<br> 
                    During the day, the sky is blanketed by a wretched thing that hides the sky that 
                    we so dearly hold to our hearts. I say this with the most certainty, after hours of 
                    staring up into the blue that is both so vast and so restricting, that I cannot see the
                     sky behind it.
                     <br>&emsp;During the night, the sky becomes more apparent, but only just. Even in the 
                     night, I still feel the veil of the Earth threatening to spill back into the sky. Even
                      under the true sky, the humans insist on creating their own light, as if the stars are
                       not enough, and they feed their veil.
                </p>

                <p><br>&emsp;After careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that humans are
                     scared of the sky. Why else would they do their best to hide it at all times of 
                     the day and night? Clearly, the humans have a deep hatred for the sky, and, dear
                      readers, I have done a bit of research on the matter in human libraries:
                    <br>&emsp;First of all, the humans keep very close track of the movement of the stars. 
                    There are many orginizations dedicated to watching them and some even keep tabs on them
                     by watching their formations– they call the formations ‘constellations.’ If the humans are 
                     not scared of the sky, then why else would they keep such close track of it?
                    <br>&emsp;I have also discovered that there are tales of a man named Atlas who holds their
                     barrier aloft as a punishment for his crimes. It is said that without Atlas, the barrier 
                     would fall, and the humans would be crushed. I feel that it is vital to keep this in mind, 
                     as if we ever war with this species, we can be certain that this is a weak point of their people.
                </p>
                <p><br>&emsp;I am ashamed to say this, but I think I understand their point of fear.
                    <br>&emsp;One night, while relishing the short time I could spend with the sky, 
                    I looked very closely at the full moon, admiring the reflection of the sun on its surface.
                </p>
                <p><br>&emsp;And for a second, I could have sworn that it blinked.
